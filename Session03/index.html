As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[22] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States,[23] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[24][25] As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.

            New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists in 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653.[27] The city came under English control in 1664 and was renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[27][28] The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674.[29][30] New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[31] and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790.[32] The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,[33] and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace.[34] In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship,[35] and environmental sustainability,[36][37] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[38] In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.
