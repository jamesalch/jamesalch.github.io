    <p>I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,<br></p>
    <p>Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,<br></p>
    <p>The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,<br></p>
    <p>The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,<br></p>
    <p>The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck,<br></p>
    <p>The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,<br></p>
    <p>The wood-cutter’s song, the ploughboy’s on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown,<br></p>
    <p>The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing,<br></p>
    <p>Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,<br></p>
    <p>The day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,<br></p>
    <p>Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.<br></p>
