<div class="words">
    <p>The world below the brine, </p>
    <p>Forests at the bottom of the sea, the branches and leaves,  </p>
    <p>Sea-lettuce, vast lichens, strange flowers and seeds, the thick tangle, openings, and pink turf,   </p>
    <p>Different colors, pale gray and green, purple, white, and gold, the play of light through the water,   </p>
    <p>Dumb swimmers there among the rocks,coral, gluten, grass, rushes, and the aliment of the swimmers,</p>
    <p>Sluggish existences grazing there suspended, or slowly crawling close to the bottom,   </p>
    <p>The sperm-whale at the surface blowing air and spray, or disporting with his flukes,   </p>
    <p>The leaden-eyed shark, the walrus, the turtle, the hairy sea-leopard, and the sting-ray,  </p>
    <p>Passions there, wars, pursuits, tribes, sight in those ocean-depths, breathing that thick-breathing air, as so many do,</p>
    <p>The change thence to the sight here, and to the subtle air breathed by beings like us who walk this sphere,</p>
    <p>The change onward from ours to that of beings who walk other spheres.</p>
